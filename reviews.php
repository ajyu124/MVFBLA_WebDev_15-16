						<h4>"Astounding gluten free food"</h4>
							<blockquote>It's not very easy to find gluten free restaurants and bakeries today, and it's even harder to find ones that have 
							good tasting food as well! I can safely say that I have found <i>the best</i> gluten free restaurant and bakery in the Bay Area, 
							and perhaps even California. The pastries are amazing and the entrees are even better. Their customer service is stellar and they
							have really found a unique way to merge with technology through their mobile stamp card. I fully recommend that everyone visit this bakery.

						<h4>"I have never been disappointed"</h4>
							<blockquote>I cannot say enough about this bakery! I've been coming here for a couple months now and have never been disappointed! 
							Everything always tastes amazing and looks just as good as it tastes. However, today I'm specifically writing because 
							of the service I received. I was ordering at the last minute, having to go back and forth with my committee for a project 
							on what to order and had a special request for them to accommodate our schedule and without hesitation, they were able
							to deliver! Like I said, I've been a customer for many years and will continue coming back and referring my family 
							and friends because they've earned the business! Keep up the great work!! <br><br>

						<h4>"Customer Service is great!!"</h4>
							<blockquote>Amazing. ..the people are all about Customer service and the treats look delicious... I can  hardly wait 
							to bite into my chocolate croissant...my blueberry muffin and my crunchy oatmeal cookie. My only problem  is which to
							eat first! Oh my mouth is watering! <br><br>

						<h4>"Just. Delicious."</h4>
							<blockquote>Panettiere's is delish! I literally bought one of everything for my offices and they all loved them. I got croissants for my
							self and they seriously taste better than ones that they sell at professional bakeries. Even my boss agrees with me! So amazing. I'll be 
							coming back for sure. <br><br> 
							
							- Kavita G, Saratoga, CA

						<h4>"Best bakery in the Bay Area!"</h4>
							<blockquote>Excellent service! Excellent food! Wonderful pastries with a very cozy atmosphere. The only set back 
							is that there was a long line and wait around dinner time which was slightly annoying. Overall, an excellent place to eat and very 
							inexpensive too! <br><br>
							- Guillermo F, Cupertino, CA
