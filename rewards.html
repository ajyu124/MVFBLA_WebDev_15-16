										<h3 class="major">Why a reward system?</h3>
										<p>Here at Panettiere Bakery, we greatly value your individual support and loyalty to our bakery. In order to try to 
										pay it back to you for your dedication, we have introduced a new <i>rewards program</i> that will not only allow you to recieve
										free drinks and pastries, but also join our special membership club for discounts and more free meals. In order to make 
										it easier for you to access these rewards, we encourage you to download the Panettiere Bakery mobile app that will update you with
										discounts and serve as your "mobile stamp card." We hope you take advantage of this offer and continue to frequent the best bakery in the world! 
										<br> 
										<p> 
										Each time you purchase an item at Panettiere Bakery, you will recieve either 1, 2, or 3 points depending on what you buy. For each drink or 
										pastry, you will recieve 1 point. For each entree that you purchase, you will recieve 2 points. For every meal that you purchase, you will 
										recieve 3 points. These points can then be redeemed for our special loyalty rewards!</p>
